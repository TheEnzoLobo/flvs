# This are my notes
## Mr Pawly is my teacher
He teaches me:
1. Programming
2. Python

And the place I learn is **FLVS**

---

And if I need to write code in my notes I can just do this:
- `is this code?`
or
- ```is this code```
let's see if it has python syntax highlighting
```python
import Turtle

def main():
	print("This is very nice")
	
main()
```
